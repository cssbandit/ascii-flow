## 📋 Development Status

This is currently maintained entirely by me, an animator and brand designer with next to no experience with building tools. This has been vibe-coded into existence using GitHub Copilot in VScode, using mostly Claude Sonnet 4, with the occaisional GPT-5 when Claude gets stumped. Please forgive any messy or unusal structure or vibe-code artifacts, I'm trying my best!

Where I'm at with the concept:
